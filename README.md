# Hello World! | こんにちは世界

I'm Ramel, a software developer 

<b>Some phrases I like</b> 

- Programming experience doesn't mean you don't create bugs, it means you recognize them quickly.
- Nothing in this world beats persistence and determination.
- First, recognize the problem, then solve the problem, and finally, create the best solution of all.
